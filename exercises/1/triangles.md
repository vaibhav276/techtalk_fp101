Write a function to return a list of triangles, each of which satisfies these constraints:
('l', and 's' are parameters to the function)
-	Has sides which are smaller than 'l' units
-	Has sides lengths which are integers
-	Is a right triangle (one angle is 90 degrees)
-	The sum of all sides is equal to 's'
